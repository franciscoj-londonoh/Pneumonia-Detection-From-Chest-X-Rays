# Pneumonia-Detection-From-Chest-X-Rays

## Project Overview
This project was part of the path to finish Udacity´s nanodegree: "AI for Healthcare", in which skills acquired in the 2D medical imaging course were applied to analyze data from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset and train a CNN to classify a given chest x-ray for the presence or absence of pneumonia. The project produced a model that can predict the presence of pneumonia with human radiologist-level accuracy. 
The model was trained using a GPU for fast training of deep learning architecture, and access to a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data) of 112,000 chest x-rays with disease labels acquired from 30,000 patients. 

## Project Highlight
The development of this project involved:
* Recommend appropriate imaging modalities for common clinical applications of 2D medical imaging
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on medical imaging data to inform model training and explain model performance
* Establish the appropriate ‘ground truth’ methodologies for training algorithms to label medical images
* Extract images from a DICOM dataset
* Train common CNN architectures to classify 2D medical images
* Translate outputs of medical imaging models for use by a clinician
* Plan necessary validations to prepare a medical imaging model for regulatory approval

## Project Steps
This project contains the following stages:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Building and Training a Model
* Clinical Workflow Integration (Inference)
